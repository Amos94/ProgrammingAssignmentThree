While apprenticed to a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, young Ainslie in 1787 formed the acquaintance of Burns, and in May of the same year he made an excursion with the poet in Teviotdale and Berwickshire. Burns stayed some days at Berrywell. A sister of Ainslie, whom Burns met on this occasion, was the subject of the impromptu beginning with ''Fair maid. `` Ainslie passed writer to the signet in 1789. He became an elder in the Church of Scotland, and was the author of two small religious works, ''A Father's Gift to his Children,`` and ''Reasons for the Hope that is in us. `` He also contributed to the ''Edinburgh Magazine`` and other periodicals. His intimacy with Burns, and his genial manners, secured him a cordial welcome in the literary circles of Edinburgh. Hogg, who speaks of him as ''honest Ainslie,`` mentions, as his one failing, constitutional sleepiness, the irresistibility of which Hogg, with characteristic egotism, illustrates by stating that he has ''seen him fall fast asleep in the blue parlour at Ambrose's, with North in the chair and myself croupier. `` Fourteen letters of Burns to Ainslie are included in the poet's correspondence. According to W. S. Douglas (Works of Burns, ii. 188), the ballad, ''Robin shure in Hairst,`` refers to a juvenile amour of Ainslie. Ainslie presented Sir Walter Scott with a manuscript copy of ''Tam o' Shanter,`` which he had received from Burns at Ellisland.

He pursued oil painting at the same time, and studied from nature and the old Dutch masters.

He was sent to the mission in Cambridgeshire. On 7 February 1686--7 James II addressed a mandatory letter under his signet manual to John Peachell, master of Magdalene College, and vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, commanding him to admit Francis to the degree as master of arts ``without administering unto him any oath or oaths whatsoever, or tendering any subscription to be made by him.'' This letter was laid before a congregation of the university on 21 February, and the senate advised that the king should be petitioned to revoke his mandate. The esquire-bedels and the registrars were sent to inform Francis that the senate were ready to admit him to the degree provided that he would swear as the law appointed, but he refused to do so, insisting upon the royal dispensation. On the same afternoon the heads met in the consistory, and agreed to send a letter to the Duke of Albemarle and another to the Earl of Sunderland, secretary of state, through whose hands the mandate had passed. A second letter from the king dated 24 February was read in the senate on 11 March. The senate, confirmed by the approval of several eminent lawyers, persisted in its refusal to comply with the royal letters. Consequently the vice-chancellor and the senate (by its deputies) were cited to appear before the ecclesiastical commissioners at Whitehall. The lord chancellor (Jeffreys) pronounced the decision of the commissioners on 7 May 1687. Peachell was deprived of the office of vice-chancellor and was suspended, ab officio et beneficio, of his mastership during his majesty's pleasure. At a subsequent sitting (12 May) the lord chancellor reprimanded the deputies of the senate. Another vice-chancellor was elected, John Balderston, master of Emmanuel College, but Francis never got his degree."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '4464315225392470006', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

After a brief time in Brooklyn, New York, the family relocated to the coal-mining city of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, when George was thirteen years old. Involved with his high school newspaper, he landed a job after high school as a reporter for the Wilkes-Barre Record. He briefly attended Columbia University to pursue studies in English and history in 1921-1922, but was forced to return home by his family's financial difficulties. Upon his return he joined the staff of the Pottsville Republican. Assigned to cover miners and their families in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, he began collecting songs and stories from them for special features and educated himself in folklore and folk song studies of the period and region. The collection was unprecedented because folklorists previously had concentrated mostly on rural Anglo-American balladry of mountaineers, cowboys, and lumbermen. His collection drew attention for showing emergent folklore of industrial life, labor movements, and immigrant traditions in a mixed-ethnic social context. In 1927, he issued his collections in book form as Songs and Ballads of the Anthracite Miner, followed by publications that included narrative and customary traditions of coal miners, such as Black Rock: Mining Folklore of the Pennsylvania Dutch (1960, winner of the Chicago Folklore Prize in that year), Coal Dust on the Fiddle: Songs and Stories of the Bituminous Industry (1943), and his essay on ``coal miners' for Pennsylvania Songs and Legends (1949), which he edited. In 1936, he became director of the Pennsylvania Folk Festival, and he served three terms as president of the Pennsylvania Folklore Society. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1957 to work on Black Rock, and garnered more national recognition for his folklore work with induction in 1960 into the American Folklore Society's honorary circle of Fellows. During the 1950s, Korson worked for the UMWA and the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. and travelled to Pennsylvania to add to his field collections in song and story. In 1965 he donated his collection of papers and recordings to the D. Leonard Corgan Library at King's College in Wilkes-Barre. In 2004, the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress announced the transfer of the collection to the Library. Korson's often strenuous field trips into the coal region were undertaken despite his battles with heart disease for much of his later life; he finally succumbed after his seventh heart attack on May 23, 1967."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11658533362118524115', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

The court account books for the year 1525-6 describe him as ''mynstrell``; he was later designated ''lewter``. Van Wilder steadily advanced his position at the Tudor court. By 1529 he was a member of the Privy chamber, the select group of musicians who played to the king in private. He was also active as a merchant, being given a licence to import Toulouse woad and Gascon wine, and in purchasing instruments for the court. He taught the lute to Princess (later Queen) Mary, who rewarded him with a gift on the occasion of his marriage to a woman named Frances in 1537.

A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Adams credits his grandfather, a former professional jazz clarinetist and accomplished pianist, as being his earliest musical inspiration. Adams began playing piano at the age of 6 and continued studying piano throughout high school and college. He worked with composer Michael Kapsner while studying abroad in Freiburg, Germany. While focusing on piano, organ, and music composition, his experience in Germany inspired Adams to continue his musical studies stateside. Adams graduated with a Bachelor's of Arts degree in Music from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. He continued his studies at the University of Alabama's School of Music in Tuscaloosa where he earned a Master's degree in Music Composition. Adams was drawn to Los Angeles in the mid ''90s to study film scoring at USC Thornton School of Music's famed Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television (SMPTV) program which is the world's most acclaimed programs of its kind. Adams worked as a freelance score composer for film and television until forming eastmountainsouth in 2001. After releasing a limited edition solo ep in 2005, Adams was praised by some critics, including The Boston Globe, who called it ``a beautiful set of Americana music...It confirms the dreamy-voiced Adams as an artist to follow.'' This effort was followed up by his first full-length solo release ''Gather Up`` in 2006. Virtually all of this album was recorded in his apartment in 2005 between touring dates. Southern California's super sessionman Greg Leisz on his famous Weisenborn guitar is featured on ''Queen of Hearts. `` Based on the response from this release, Peter was named ``Notable New Artist of the Year'' in 2006 by The Loft (Sirius XM) Satellite Radio.'' Before recording his next collection of music, Adams headed east to Nashville to be closer to musicians and producers with whom he wanted to work. While working on ''Gather Up`` Adams formed a collaborative bond with well-known session player and producer Lex Price. Now based out of Brooklyn, NY (via Nashville, Alabama, and Los Angeles) Adams is anything but a ``Nashville artist.'' Adams is currently signed to Sarathan Records (based in Seattle, Washington) which released his sophomore solo release, ``Leavetaking.''

Although he initially opposed the formation of the Birmingham Political Union, and remained less radical than Thomas Attwood, the BPU's founder, Parkes worked with it during the period of agitation for the Reform Act - acting in effect as an intermediary between radicals and whigs. In 1833 Henry Brougham appointed Parkes secretary of the commission on municipal corporations; he combined this work with a successful Westminster practice as a parliamentary solicitor. Co-proprietor of the Birmingham Journal from 1832 to 1844, Parkes also wrote leaders for the Morning Chronicle and Times.

He arrived in Korea in 1887 as a Methodist minister; while there, he not only made major contributions to the spread of Christianity in Korea, but also founded three academic journals: The Korean Repository, The Korean Review, and Shinhak Wolbo (Theology Monthly). He also played a significant role in encouraging Korean migration to Hawaii; of the first ship of Korean migrant laborers bound for Hawaii to work on sugar plantations there, which departed on 22 December 1902, more than half came from his church in Incheon. In July 1907, he was the subject of a murder attempt; Yale University professor George Trumbull Ladd attributed the attack to opinions Jones had expressed in an article he wrote about the suppression of a Korean riot, in which he praised the Japanese police. In general, Jones had a high opinion of Koreans but not of Korean culture; in particular, he wrote high praise for Korean migrants in Hawaii, attributing their success in their adopted land to their liberation from ``the oppressive weight of past tradition, language, and association''.

Most say he was born in Spain in 1766 and served in the Spanish Navy aboard the Floridablanca. Among his early exploits was his kidnapping of a young girl for ransom; some versions give his subsequent capture as the impetus for joining the navy. Simpler versions of the story have him starting a mutiny and becoming a pirate soon after, but more romantic ones say he achieved a high rank and became a councillor to King Charles III. He was popular in the court, but when he spurned one lover for another, the jilted lady levied false charges against him, often said to involve the theft of the crown jewels. To escape arrest he commandeered his ship and vowed to exact revenge on his country through piracy. Renaming himself ``Gasparilla'', he patrolled the coast of Spanish Florida for the next 38 years (often 1783 -- 1821, approximately the dates of the second Spanish rule of Florida), sacking every passing ship and amassing a huge treasure, which was stored in his fabulous den on Gasparilla Island. Most male prisoners would be put to death or recruited as pirates, while women would be taken to a nearby isle, called Captiva Island for this reason, where they would serve as concubines or await ransom payment from their families."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11658533362118524115', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

His short stories, Pictures From Life, first appeared in 1904; and novels, King of the Forest (1897), Village Schoolmistress (1899) and Wrecked Ideals (1900) deal with the life of the Serbian peasantry and intelligentsia in the late 19th century. The theme of the tragic conflict between man and The Establishment resonates through all his novels.

{'pred': '/people/person/place_of_birth', 'sub': 'Algernon Sydney Sullivan', 'obj': 'Madison', 'evidences': [{'url': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algernon_Sydney_Sullivan', 'snippet': "Sullivan was born at Madison, Indiana April 5, 1826, son of Jeremiah and Charlotte Rudesel (Cutler) Sullivan. He was named in honor of the British politician, Algernon Sidney. His father (1794--1870) was a lawyer, a major in the war of 1812, a member of the Indiana legislature in 1821, and judge of the criminal court of Jefferson County, Ind., and a judge of the supreme court (1837--46). His grandfather, Thomas Littleton Sullivan, the son of an Irish barrister, emigrated from Charleville, County Cork, Ireland, in 1791, to Augusta County, Va. Algernon S. Sullivan was educated at Hanover College, Hanover, Ind., and at Miami University, Oxford, O., where he was graduated in 1845. While a law student, about the age of twenty, he made a tour of Indiana, speaking with marked success in advocacy of taxation for the maintenance of public schools. After studying law in his father's office, he was admitted to the bar in 1848, and for eight years practiced in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1857 he moved to New York city, and soon took a prominent position as a lawyer and public spirited citizen. He was retained to defend the officers and crew of the Confederate schooner Savannah, the first vessel to be captured during the civil war, who were on trial for their lives on the charge of piracy. Owing to some inimical reports about him, he was arrested and imprisoned, but soon released. After the trial began, public feeling ran so high that his life was threatened if he should appear in their defense. He nevertheless did so, telling his friends that, having been appealed to as a lawyer, he could consider no other course, and the ultimate result of the trial was that the men were exchanged as prisoners of war. From 1870-73 Mr. Sullivan was assistant district attorney for New York city, and upon leaving that office he formed a partnership with Hermann Kobbe and Ludlow Fowler. In 1875 he was appointed public administrator, during which he instituted many reforms, reducing the charges upon estates administered, and, in spite of pressure, retaining in his service efficient assistants of a political party different from his own. In 1878 the firm of Sullivan, Kobbe & Fowler was dissolved and he formed a partnership with William Nelson Cromwell, under the name of Sullivan & Cromwell, which firm name is still retained by the successors to his business. Mr. Sullivan was recognized as one of the strongest, readiest and most successful jury lawyers in New York, and he was admired and revered by both bench and bar. His kindness, candor and fairness, even during the heat of a trial, were always the subject of remark. Judge Bookstaver, of New York, in speaking of him, said: ``He was always welcomed by the court in any case in which he appeared, because it was felt that his learning, ability and absolute truthfulness would assist the court in the trial of any question of law and fact with which it had to deal.'' He was noted for seeking opportunities for helping and encouraging younger lawyers. His interests were very broad, and his sympathy both deep and active. No individual ever appealed to him without receiving what was needed, either money, service, guidance or encouragement. There were few movements for public welfare, alleviation of suffering or the upholding of high ideals that did not receive his efficient aid. He was a brilliant and convincing orator, and was often chosen to speak at public gatherings because of his prominence and eloquence. One of his most famous orations was at the laying of the cornerstone of the Produce Exchange, made at an hour's notice. In all of his work there was great readiness, versatility and ease. On the platform he was peculiarly attractive and effective. He was tall, handsome in face and form, graceful in movement, impressive and most winning in manner and presence. His voice was full, penetrating, musical and sympathetic. His style was direct, simple and vividly realistic. He was a Whig in politics until 1856, when he became a Democrat, in which party he remained until his death. He was active in party work, but with great independence."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '5505751039176460562', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

The first the novels, written in the 1970s, were basically coming of age or bildungsroman novels. The next three, his third, fourth and fifth books (``The Good Son, ''The Congressman's Daughter`` and ''Tornado Alley``) are often thought of as his Passion Trilogy, sharing similar structures (each novel is broken up into different ''books``; each novel is narrated in the first person by a variety of characters, male and female). And the books share similar geography, with stories that either take place largely in the East (as it does in ''The Congressman's Daughter``), or which begin on the East coast and gradually move West. ''The Good Son`` starts out in the East (Ohio), New York and in New England (Vermont, etc.), where Nova lived for over three decades, and its denouement takes place in both the West (Washington) and East, New York. ''Tornado Alley``, The last book in the Passion Trilogy moves the action from the East coast (Pennsylvania) across country to the West coast, in California, where the majority of Nova's story about passion, adultery and unrequited love plays out. In each book, a serious conflict arises between parent and child, or man and wife (or both), usually due to one or both of them being in love (complicated triangles were part of Nova's well-written bag of tricks during this era of his career). This Passion Trilogy may well prove to be Nova's personal masterpiece. In its unerring ability to capture Americans of all classes (lower, middle and upper) and the struggles for power that take place everyday (between father and son, father and daughter, husband and wife, etc.), and its uncanny ability to capture the voices of characters feminine and masculine, the three novels and writing therein are reminiscent of the best work of Booth Tarkington. A book critic for the Seattle Times was moved to write, ''I see them as the all-American prose equivalent to Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 3, 5 and 7. ...there's a genuinely classical grandeur to Nova's tales of erotic derailment and titanic family conflict. `` Nova's next three novels, his seventh, eighth and ninth books (''Trombone``, ''The Book of Dreams``, and ''The Universal Donor``), are linked geographically, with all of the action taking place on the West coast, largely in California, where Nova was born and raised. As a child, he played with the daughter of Jane Mansfield and as a teenager, raced against Steve McQueen. His Hollywood childhood was put to good use in his California trilogy of novels that taken on relationships the various people (lovers, fathers, friends and others) wrapped up in movie-making and con games, with the lines between both often being blurred. In his three most recent novels (''Wetware``, ''Cruisers``, and ''The Informer``), Nova has moved into the genre of crime and mystery fiction, taking cues and borrowing tropes from writers like William Gibson (''Wetware``), James M.

Chapman later reflected, ``I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd hit one place lower.'' He initially studied engineering in the department headed by Osborne Reynolds. Chapman was taught mathematics by Horace Lamb, the Bayer professor of mathematics, and JE Littlewood, who came from Cambridge in Chapman's final year at Manchester. Although he graduated with an engineering degree, Chapman had become so enthusiastic for mathematics that he stayed for one further year to take a mathematics degree. Following Lamb's suggestion, Chapman applied for a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was at first awarded only a partial scholarship as a sizar (meaning that he obtained financial support by acting as a servant other students), but from his second year onwards he received a full scholarship. He graduated as a wrangler in 1910. He began researching in pure mathematics under G. H. Hardy, but later that year was asked by Sir Frank Dyson to be his chief assistant at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. From 1914 to 1919 he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in mathematics and a fellow of Trinity.

Eliza was the only child of his marriage with the eldest daughter of William Hill. The mother died ten days after the birth. At eleven years old Eliza, a beautiful, intelligent girl, was sent to the Manor School at York. The mistress (Mrs. Forster) was ''a very well-disposed, conscientious old gentlewoman,`` but incapable of proper superintendence. ''Four volumes of the ``Spectator'' constituted the whole school library. `` Miss Dawson had a profound admiration for William Mason the poet, then a York notability, especially on account of his ''Monody`` upon his wife's death, and was shocked at seeing him ''a little fat old man of hard-favoured countenance,`` devoted to whist. When she was seventeen accident brought to her father's house a Scotch advocate, Archibald Fletcher v., ''of about forty-three, and of a grave, gentlemanlike, prepossessing appearance. `` They carried on a literary correspondence for a year, and after another meeting became engaged, though the father opposed the union, preferring a higher suitor, Lord Grantley. Miss Dawson got a friend, Dr. Kilvington, to tell Lord Grantley of her engagement. On 16 July 1791 the lovers were married in Tadcaster Church. Her father did not sanction the ceremony by his presence, but he could not withhold his blessing. For seven-and-thirty years, at the end of which time her husband died, ''there was not a happier couple in the three kingdoms. `` Fletcher's steady adherence to his whig principles prevented his getting into practice, and they were often reduced to their last guinea. Her sympathy prevented her from ever regretting the sacrifice to principle. Afterwards success in life set steadily in with little interruption. Mrs. Fletcher died at Edinburgh 5 Feb. 1858. Her ''Autobiography,`` of which a few copies had been printed for private circulation, 8vo, Carlisle, 1874, was published at Edinburgh the following year under the editorship of her surviving child, the widow of Sir John Richardson, the Arctic explorer. The ''Life`` also contains a memoir by Mrs. Fletcher of her daughter Grace, and another of her son Archibald, by his widow.

Rice would eventually follow in Todd and Davies`` footsteps, working among slaves as an ordained Presbyterian minister in Virginia for over twenty years. After being forced out of Virginia, Rice joined the efforts of the Kentucky Abolition Society, serving also as a member of the 1792 Kentucky Constitutional Convention. It was as a member of the convention that Rice pleaded for a gradual emancipation initiative, giving an address entitled, Slavery Inconsistent with Justice and Good Policy. Ultimately, Rice saw the institution of slavery as not only unconstitutional, but as that which violated the most basic tenets of a natural, moral law. He believed, moreover, that it was especially the responsibility of the church to lead the cause for emancipation, expressing in 1799 in a letter to a friend that he wanted Christians to adopt ``a rational plan for the gradual abolition of slavery; and do it under the influence of religion and conscience, without any regard for law'' (Letter to James Blythe, 1799). In 1792, Rice served as an elected delegate to the Danville convention of 1792 where he pushed for the insertion of a clause in the state's first constitution that would have ended slavery. Rice, ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts towards abolition, served for much of the rest of his life in the Kentucky Abolition Society.

I. Prime and E. D. G. Prime, born at Cambridge, New York. William Prime graduated Princeton in 1843 and delivered a poem at commencement. He was admitted to the New York Bar in 1846 and began to practice law in New York City. In 1851 he married Mary Trumbull of Stonington, Connecticut (Dictionary of Art Historians). During 1855 and 1856, Prime traveled in Europe, North Africa, and the Holy Land. He published Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia and Tent Life in the Holy Land based on his experiences there, which include his accounts of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Dead Sea, and the port of Jaffa, among others. In The Innocents Abroad, Mark Twain parodies Tent Life in the Holy Land as Grime's Nomadic Life in Palestine, taking aim at Prime's overly sentimental prose and his violent encounters with the local inhabitants. Twain makes the contemporary popularity of Tent Life evident in his parody: ``Some of us will be shot before we finish this pilgrimage. The pilgrims read ''Nomadic Life`` and keep themselves in a constant state of Quixotic heroism.`` Twain speculates that if a homicide did occur, Grimes should be prosecuted as an ''accessory before the fact.`` Prime continued practicing law until 1861, when he became part owner and editor-in-chief of the New York Journal of Commerce. In 1869 he gave up his editorial work and revisited Egypt and the Holy Land. It was at his insistence that Princeton established a department of art history, to which he donated his extensive collection of ceramic art. In 1884, the Trustees of the College elected Prime as the department's first chair. His interest in art matters brought him into close connection with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, of which he was elected first vice-president in 1874.

As NAACP president, and with limited help from other blacks Clark pressed forward, implementing every NAACP initiative he could--challenging the racial conditions of unpaved streets, inadequate school facilities, and books, desegregation, voter registration, and after desegregation, served as a staunch advocate for the children attending schools in Randolph County, Alabama.

His first designs were for the intarsia inlay in the fittings for the New Sacristy of the Duomo, Florence, carried out in collaboration with Benedetto in 1463-1465, where Giuliano carved the wooden bas-reliefs of putti and garlands in the frieze, and for works in Palazzo Vecchio in collaboration with Benedetto, notably the ceiling in octagonal compartments and the white marble doorcase in Benedetto's Sala d'Audienza intarsia in the Sala dei Dugento (1472-1477) and in the Sala del Giglio.

He is also claimed by Holywood, County Down, this being based on a suggestion of Richard Stanihurst. However, Pederson attributes this assertion to Holywood being known to Stanihurst. Pedersons book mentioned that in 1639 James Ware assumed that the birthplace of Sacrobosco was near Dublin. Stanihurst and even Pederson were probably unaware that the seat of the Sacrobosco/Hollywood family in Ireland was in Artane, a suburb of Dublin (``The History of the County of Dublin'' by John D'Alton published in 1838).

He received his Bachelor of Music from Oxford with the support of the Earl of Bath in 1613, and also from Cambridge in 1640. He was employed as both an organist and clergyman at the Cathedral after he obtained his first degree. He was subsequently ordained to the diaconate, later becoming vicarius (minor canon). In 1615, he published a collection entitled Sacred Hymnes of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts for the Voyces and Vyols, which represents most of his known works. His other works include Preces (both for five voices), four settings of the daily canticles, several simple four-part anthems, slightly more complex five-part anthems, and verse anthems. Roughly a dozen of these works were recorded in the 1990s, and many were performed by the Ely Cathedral choir, including Blessed be the Lord God; Hear, O Lord; Have mercy; I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; My Lord is hence removed and laid; O sing unto the Lord; O ye little flock; the Second Service (Cesar's) and Sing, O heav'ns.

One day the Pandyan king of the land had a competition between scholars to find one who would explain philosophical principles. Vishnuchittar won the competition by explaining that the path to moksha is by service to God. Legend goes that the king honored Vishnuchittar and God himself came down to earth to see this.

After an unsuccessful proposal of marriage to his childhood sweetheart, he left Copenhagen to serve as the pastor of a ship during its two year journey to China. While on the journey, he read the complete works of Cicero, wrote poetry, and wrote in his journal. After returning to Copenhagen, he began teaching Greek and writing poetry and fiction. He later successfully proposed to his first wife, with whom he had four sons. From 1826 to 1832, he taught at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania. Although he rose from assistant professor to full professor, he disliked living in Norway and returned to Denmark. Although eccentric, notoriously disheveled, and prone to becoming distracted during lessons, his good nature and pleasant disposition allowed him to become a popular teacher. In 1831, he was promoted to Professor Extraordinary at the University of Copenhagen, where he taught Hegel, classical literature, and moral philosophy. His first wife died in 1834, an event which left him shaken to the core and almost unable to function. Two years later, he married a friend of his late wife.

According to Turvey, the allegation of Henry VIII's fatherhood originated with Sir Robert Naunton (1563--1635). Naunton never knew Sir John, and used second-hand accounts of his person and character, along with a series of historically inaccurate events to reach his conclusion on John's paternity. For example, John was Mary Berkeley's third child, not her first, and history does not record her and the king being in the same location during this period. Naunton even claimed that Sir Owen Hopton, Lieutenant of the Tower of London, overheard Sir John say, 'Will the Queen suffer her brother to be offered up a sacrifice to the envy of his frisking adversaries? ' thus suggesting that Perrot himself fueled the rumours of his paternity. However, Hopton had been removed from the Tower 18 months prior to Perrot's imprisonment, so he could not have overheard Perrot make the claim there."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1855142007844680025', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

His first instrument was the violin, which he studied at age 10. While attending school in Hořice he was classmates with Jan Kubelík, with whom he maintained correspondence. He spent time performing both the violin and the cornet for a circus band in Prague. He also performed as an aerialist acrobat with the Rentz Circus in Germany, but an accident in 1886 ended this line of work. His father was a sculptor, and Bohumir also studied this art. He emigrated to the United States in 1889, paying the fare in part by performing with the ship's orchestra. Moving to Chicago, English sculptor H.R. Saunders furthered his profession in that area. Bohumir followed Saunders to Indianapolis and was soon employed, along with his brother, as a sculptor by General Lew Wallace and also working on the Soldiers`` and Sailor's Monument. During this time he joined the When Clothing Company Band, playing the cornet and soloing on this instrument. Before long he was hired by John Philip Sousa, but left in 1898 to join Thomas Preston Brooke's Chicago Marine Band, where he spent the next two years. During this time he studied with Weldon of Chicago's Second Regiment Band. In 1901 he spent some time with Phinney's United States Band, but he joined the Duss Band permanently that year. This group was based at Madison Square Garden, at $800 per-month and became its assistant conductor in 1903. This band, led by Frederick Innes, was not as well known, but he was hired as soloist, and the heavy touring schedule and two solos per concert gained him wide exposure. His solos would result in requests for multiple encores. Studying bandleaders Creatore and Vessela, he adopted a wild 'lionesque' hairstyle that became his trademark. He became acquainted with Joseph Jiran, who owned a Czechoslovakian music store in Chicago. With Jiran's encouragement, he formed his own band in 1906 styled as Kryl's Bohemian Band by 1910 with the Cimera brothers. This group worked for Columbia, Victor, and Zonophone, recording works by such composers as Smetana, Dvorak, and Safranek. He earned the distinction of the first Czech musician to record on phonograph cylinders. World War I interrupted his professional career, as he was serving in the U.S. Military. Here he attained the rank of Lieutenant and was given the title ``Bandmaster of all the Military Camp Bands in the country``. Immediately after the war he was touring with his bands, including many appearances on the Chautauqua circuit. This activity continued until he dismantled the band in 1931. From 1926 to 1929 he would spend winters at his mansion in Tarpon Springs, Florida. He built a bandshell on his property and would give numerous concerts each year. Through his compositions and band touring, he became a millionaire by the mid 1920s. The Great Depression did not affect his personal affluence as much as others, as he was a bank president and a known financier in 1932. He later formed a ``Women's Symphony Orchestra'' that featured daughter Josephine on violin and daughter Marie on piano. He also formed and conducted the ''Kryl Symphony Orchestra``, which featured soloists such as Florian ZaBach and vocalist Mary McCormic. His public musical career ended in the late 1940s, when he had difficulties with the American Federation of Musicians, because although his musicians were well taken care of, he did not pay scale. His last groups played popular dance music as well as ''heavier classics``. Before his musical retirement, he had traveled more than one million miles and soloed more than 12,000 times. His touring included many small towns such as Albany, Oregon and Bend, Oregon, where his orchestra was the first appearance by any symphony orchestra there. Aside from the United States, he toured Canada, Cuba, and Mexico with his bands and orchestras and America and Europe with his daughters. He later formed booking agency and a music bureau. An Honorary Doctor of Letters was given to him in 1957. He died at his summer home in Wilmington, New York, on August 7, 1961, leaving an estate valued at over 1 million dollars. His widow was Mary Jerabek Kryl."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '5505751039176460562', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

He proceeded B.A. in 1649, and M.A. 8 July 1651, and in 1656 became principal of St. Mary Hall. As a tutor he had ''some eminent divines`` for pupils, among whom was John Locke. The restoration of Charles II was followed by the ejection of Cole from his position at Oxford. He then opened an academy at Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, and one of those under his charge was Samuel Wesley, the father of the founder of methodism. Samuel Wesley was the son of an ejected minister, but having entered the church, he attacked his former tutor, whose character was cleared by Samuel Palmer in his ''Vindication of the Dissenters. `` In February 1674 Cole succeeded Philip Nye as minister of the now extinct independent congregation of Silver Street, London. He was also one of the ministers of the merchants' lecture at Pinners' Hall. His church, after leaving Silver Street, met at Tallow Chandlers' Hall, Dowgate Hill, and afterwards at Pinners' Hall, where he preached his last sermon 22 Aug. 1697. Cole is described by Palmer as ''a man of a most innocent and spotless life in his usual conversation. `` Beyond three sermons in the ''Morning Exercises,`` 1674, and one in the ''Casuistical Morning Exercise,`` 1690, his writings are: 1. ''The old Apostolical Way of Preaching: a funeral sermon for Rev. Edward West,`` London, 1676. 2. ''Discourses on Regeneration, Faith, and Repentance,`` London, 1689. 3. ''The Incomprehensibleness of imputed Righteousness for Justification by Human Reason, till enlightened by the Spirit of God,`` London, 1692. 4. ''Discourses on the Christian Religion,`` London, 1700. A manuscript copy of some of his sermons, including his last, with an account of his deathbed conversation, is described by Wilson, who gives from it an account of his decease, 16 Sept. 1697, in the seventieth year of his age. A copy of verses by him is prefixed to Cartwright's poems in 1653, and there is another in the Oxford collection on the peace in 1654.

After returning to England and marrying Elizabeth Clare on 11 August 1886, the couple soon migrated to Victoria (Australia) where Grayson worked as a nursery gardener. Becoming interested in science he joined the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria, studied botany and did some work on the diatoms, a group of minute plants. Grayson attended meetings of the Royal Microscopical Society and developed a talent for preparing microscope slides. Before 1894 he had constructed a machine for making micrometer rulings on glass, the results being very good for that time. In 1897 some very beautiful work Grayson had done in cutting sections of plants led to his being given a position in the physiology department of the university of Melbourne under Professor Martin. He was afterwards transferred to the geology department, and in December 1901 accompanied Professor Gregory on his expedition to Central Australia. In the preface to The Dead Heart of Australia Gregory paid a special tribute ``To my assistant Mr Grayson on whom much of the hard work of the expedition fell''. In 1910 Grayson was associated with D. J. Mahony in the preparation of a paper on ``The Geology of the Camperdown and Mount Elephant Districts'' (No. 9 in the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Victoria), and in the same year, while working at the university under professor Skeats, who succeeded Gregory, Grayson made a highly efficient apparatus for preparing rock sections, a description of which will be found in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria for the year 1911."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11658533362118524115', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1855142007844680025', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

He received no education except some desultory instruction at a school held in the Wesleyan chapel, which he supplemented by private study. About 1850 he obtained a situation as store-boy at the locomotive works of the London and North-Western railway at Longsight. Two years later he was bound apprentice as a fitter and turner at the same works. Encouraged by the locomotive superintendent, Mr. Ramsbottom, he applied himself especially to Latin, Greek, and the natural sciences, and when seventeen began to attend the evening classes at the Manchester Mechanics' Institution. A year later he became lay preacher for the Wesleyans, but on account of his scientific opinions he had to abandon his notion of becoming a minister. After a brief stay in the engineer draughtsman's office at the Crewe works, he obtained in 1863 a position as sub-editor on the Norwich Mercury under Richard Noverra Bacon. Subsequently he became editor of the Norwich People's Journal, an offshoot of the Mercury, and under him the Journal speedily became a success. His leisure was devoted to scientific study, and from 1858 onwards he was a popular lecturer on science. In conjunction with John Gunn he established the Norwich Geological Society in 1864, and founded the Science Gossip Club (Norwich) in 1870.

Coming to Melbourne, he obtained a position at Parer's hotel where he eventually became a chef. It has been stated that the modelling of ornaments for wedding cakes first turned his thoughts in the direction of sculpture. He entered the national gallery drawing school in 1888 and attended for two and a half years, but never went on to the painting school. In the late 1890s he began to exhibit at the Yarra Sculptors' Society and the Victorian Artists' Society. Until 1905 his work was all in marble and when he began experimenting in casting in bronze he met with many difficulties and could find no one in Melbourne to help him. He persevered, became an excellent caster, and among others did portrait heads in bronze of John Mather, A. McClintock, John Shirlow, Hugh McCrae and Bernard O'Dowd. The last was acquired for the National Gallery of Victoria in 1913 under the Felton bequest. In May 1914, encouraged and helped by an American resident of Melbourne, Hugo Meyer, Gilbert went to London and in spite of the war persevered with his work as he was well over military age . He exhibited at the Royal Academy where the sincerity of his work met with early appreciation, and in 1917 his marble head ``The Critic'' was purchased for the Tate Gallery through the Chantrey Bequest. He was nominated also for an associateship of the Royal Academy. He was then employed as a war artist by the Commonwealth government and made, for the war museum, many models of land over which the Australians fought.

He was admitted into the Academy of St. Luke at Rome in 1686, and in 1694 into that of Paris. The Louvre possesses the 'Mars and Rhea Sylvia,' which he painted for his reception, and an able work representing the 'Miracle of St. Hyacinthe.

His latest collection of poems is Clinging to the Myth (2007) in which he refelects on grief and personal bereavement and uses the voices of 18th century Gaelic poetry to respond to the challenges of a post-Christian Ireland.

His short stories and novels very often deal with ``losers'' -- as a very young man, he himself became handicapped while at war. His work shows Paul Pörtner to be a writer who was deeply drawn to the burlesque as well as having his characters act in desperate ways. He loved experimental language and word play. His interest in avant-garde theatre led him to the theories of Jacob Levy Moreno, Antonin Artaud and Erwin Piscator. However, through his work on stage as director and playwright he fell under the charm of the commedia dell'arte, Kurt Schwitters or Alfred Jarry. In 1963 Paul Pörtner invented the interactive play Scherenschnitt oder Der Mörder sind Sie where the audience takes over the leading role. It premiered the same year at the Ulmer Theatre, and thereafter, 75 German-speaking theatres followed. In the USA Scherenschnitt, entitled Shear Madness, became the longest running play ever done in American history. Eighteen productions in other countries have made Scherenschnitt a singular international hit: following Agatha Christie`s Mouse Trap, Paul Pörtner`s interactive play is the longest-running play around the world. In addition to 17 theatre plays, Pörtner wrote more than 20 radio plays that are still influential in this typically German genre."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '2050861176556883424', 'judgment': 'yes'}]}

While Waldman was working at the Pain Clinic at Mayo, clinicians Lee Nauss and Joe Wang brought Yaksh's exciting basic science discoveries into clinical practice by being among the first physicians to inject morphine into the subarachnoid space to treat pain. This experience fueled Waldman's interest in pain management and led him to return to his home town of Kansas City, Missouri to establish one of the first full time private practices of pain management in the country. Recognizing the need for education about the specialty of pain management and what it could offer patients suffering from pain, Waldman lectured around the country on the unrealized potential of the specialty and begin writing extensively on the subject. Serving on the Editorial Boards of numerous journals devoted to pain including The Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, Pain Digest, The American Journal of Pain Management, Headache Quarterly, Archives of Oncology, and as Editor-In Chief of Analgesiafile, Waldman further helped define the specialty of pain management. He also began teaching at the UMKC School of Medicine where he has remained on the clinical faculty for almost 30 years. As the only full time practitioner of pain management in the Kansas City area in the early 1980s, Waldman opened pain management clinics in over 20 area hospitals and by doing so established the specialty of pain management as an integral and necessary part of patient care in the region. In 1983, Waldman founded The Headache & Pain Center in Leawood, Kansas(a Kansas City suburb), the first single specialty accredited surgical center devoted solely to the treatment of pain in the nation. The Center ultimately employed 28 full time physicians in the specialties of pain management, neurology, orthopedic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and neurosurgery, attracting patients from all over the country. He later, with other area physicians opened Doctors Hospital to provide an inpatient facility which specialized in more advanced pain management treatments such as implantable technologies which often required in-patient stays. Waldman sold his interest in the Center and Hospital in 2008 to devote his time to teaching and writing."}], 'judgments': [{'rater': '16651790297630307764', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '1014448455121957356', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '16169597761094238409', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '17082466750572480596', 'judgment': 'no'}, {'rater': '11595942516201422884', 'judgment': 'no'}]}

The first song he ever played on was ``Papa was a Rolling Stone'' by The Temptations. That year the album won five Grammy Awards. After playing on numerous albums, when Motown moved offices to California they paid for him to move so they could continue using his services as a session guitar player. He soon joined the group Rare Earth and is credited as being co-writer on three songs from the Back to Earth album. After quitting Motown as a studio player in 1975, Ray Manzarek of The Doors employed Paul to become lead guitarist for his new band Nite City. By their second album Paul had also become the lead singer and wrote a number of songs on the Album Golden Days Diamond Night. The band had separated by the release of their second album. Paul Warren by 1978 had formed his own band Paul Warren and Explorer - and was a regular on the Sunset Strip scene playing almost every weekend at either the Roxy, Whiskey a Go Go, the Starwood, and Madame Wongs in China Town - among many others. He was signed by RSO Records and released his first solo album One of the Kids in 1980. Later that year RSO Records folded and Paul Warren found himself unemployed. He began being a guitar player for hire between the years 1981 and 1987, working for such greats and The Ventures, Tina Turner and Prism. He is also credited as producing a number of records in this era. In 1987 he joined Richard Marx at the beginning of his career soon after the first release of his first song from his debut album. Paul was Richard Marx's Musical Director for seven years before quitting in 1994, as his career as an artist was coming to an end. The day after quitting Richard he went straight out on the road to work as lead guitarist for Joe Cocker. The ``Have a Little Faith Tour'' lasted eighteen months. In 1996 he was then employed by Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti. His guitar playing for Eros lasted eleven years before quitting for good in 2005. In the interim in 1999 he was employed in between tours with Eros to work as guitarist for Rod Stewart. He has now been playing for Stewart for eleven years.
